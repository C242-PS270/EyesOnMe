## Steps to Replicate

These are the replication steps:

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ariff-m/JanTune.git
cd JanTune
cd "Cloud Computing"
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Clone the repository
```bash
npm install bcrypt dotenv express jsonwebtoken multer mysql2 nodemon
```


## Step 3: Create the Database

To create the database, follow these steps:

1. Download the database.sql file from the Cloud Computing directory.
2. Execute the SQL commands in the downloaded `database.sql` file to set up the necessary database structure.

## Step 4: Configure the .env file

- Rename the env.example file to .env
- Edit the content of .env according to your configuration, for example:
```bash
PORT=8000 
DB_HOST=localhost 
DB_USERNAME=your_username 
DB_PASSWORD=your_password 
DB_NAME=tuanutebd 
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

## Step 5: Run the application
```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and visit http://localhost:8000 in the terminal. If everything runs smoothly, you have successfully replicated this application.

## Step 6: Test the API

It is recommended to use Postman for testing. For documentation, refer to the instructions above.
